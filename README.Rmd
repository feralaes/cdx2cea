[`cdx2cea`](https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea) is an R package that implements the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of testing average-risk Stage II colon cancer patients for the absence of CDX2 biomarker expression followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. 
<!-- The main website of `cdx2cea` can be [found here](https://feralaes.github.io/cdx2cea/). -->

[`cdx2cea`](https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea) is part of the following manuscript:

## Preliminaries
- Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Install `devtools` to install `cdx2cea` as a package and modify it to generate your own package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Or install development version from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

We recommend reading the tutorials on cohort state-rtansition models (cSTMs) in R:

[An Introductory Tutorial on Cohort State-Transition Models in R Using a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Example](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0272989X221103163). [Medical Decision Making](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mdm), 2023;43(1):3-20. https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X221103163

- Alarid-Escudero F, Krijkamp EM, Enns EA, Yang A, Hunink MGM, Pechlivanoglou P, Jalal H.

and understanding the use of multidimensional arrays to represent cSTM dynamics in R described in:

- Krijkamp EM, Alarid-Escudero F, Enns EA, Pechlivanoglou P, Hunink MGM, Yang A, Jalal HJ. [A multidimensional array representation of state-transition model dynamics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0272989X19893973).

and familiarizing with the [DARTH](http://darthworkgroup.com) coding framework described in:

- Alarid-Escudero F, Krijkamp EM, Pechlivanoglou P, Jalal HJ, Kao SYZ, Yang A, Enns EA. [A Need for Change! A Coding Framework for Improving Transparency in Decision Modeling](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-019-00837-x). [PharmacoEconomics](https://www.springer.com/journal/40273), 2190;37(11):1329â€“1339. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00837-x

To run the CEA, you require [`dampack`: Decision-Analytic Modeling Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dampack/index.html), an R package for analyzing and visualizing the health economic outputs of decision models.

## Usage and installation 
`cdx2cea` repository could be used in two different ways:

1. [Regular coding template](#use-repository-as-a-regular-coding-template) for using it to generate a repository of your own model-based decision or cost-effectiveness analysis
2. [R package](#use-as-an-r-package) for using it as a standalone package to run current functions of `cdx2cea`

<!-- The main website of the package could be found in: https://feralaes.github.io/feralaes/ -->

## Use repository as a regular coding template
1. On the `cdx2cea` GitHub repository, navigate to the main page of the repository (https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea).
2. Above the file list, click **Clone or download** and select either 
    a. **Open in desktop**, which requires the user to have a GitHub desktop installed, or
    b. **Download zip** that will ask the user to download the whole repository as a .zip file.
3. Open the RStudio project `cdx2cea.Rproj`.
4. Install all the required and suggested packages listed in the  [*DESCRIPTION*](https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file in the main folder of the repository
    - To install `cdx2cea`, please follow these instructions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("feralaes/cdx2cea")
```
5. In RStudio, load all the functions and data from the repository by typing `devtools::load_all(".")`
6. Run all the decision modeling modules in the analysis folder.

## Use as an R package
1. Install the development version of `cdx2cea` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("feralaes/cdx2cea")
```

2. Load all the functions and data from the repository by typing 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(cdx2cea)
```
