[`cdx2cea`](https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea) is an R package that implements the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the of testin avereag-risk Stage II colon cancer patients for the absence of CDX2 biomarker followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The main website of `cdx2cea` can be [found here](https://darth-git.github.io/cdx2cea/).

[`cdx2cea`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/cdx2cea) is part of the following manuscript:

- Alarid-Escudero F, Schrag D, Kuntz KM. "CDX2 biomarker testing and adjuvant therapy for stage II colon cancer: An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis" (Under review)

# Preliminaries
- Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Install `devtools` to install `darthpack` as a package and modify it to generate your own package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Or install development version from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

# Usage and installation 
`cdx2cea` repository could be used in two different ways:

1. [Regular coding template](#use-repository-as-a-regular-coding-template) for using it to generate a repository of your own model-based decision or cost-effectiveness analysis
2. [R package](#use-as-an-r-package) for using it as a standalone package to run current functions of `darthpack`

The main website of the package could be found in: https://darth-git.github.io/darthpack/

## Use repository as a regular coding template
1. On the `cdx2cea` GitHub repository, navigate to the main page of the repository (https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea).
2. Above the file list, click **Clone or download** and select either 
    a. **Open in desktop**, which requires the user to have a GitHub desktop installed, or
    b. **Download zip** that will ask the user to download the whole repository as a .zip file.
3. Open the RStudio project `cdx2cea.Rproj`.
4. Install all the required and suggested packages listed in the  [*DESCRIPTION*](https://github.com/feralaes/cdx2cea/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file in the main folder of the repository
    - To install `dampack`, please follow these instructions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("feralaes/cdx2cea")
```
5. In RStudio, load all the functions and data from the repository by typing `devtools::load_all(".")`
6. Run all the decision modeling modules in the analysis folder.

## Use as an R package
1. Install the development version of `cdx2cea` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("feralaes/cdx2cea")
```

2. Load all the functions and data from the repository by typing 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(cdx2cea)
```
